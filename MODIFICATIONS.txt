Modifications to HuggingFace Transformers
-----------------------------------------

This directory contains custom modifications made by the EG-CFG Research Team
at Tel Aviv University as part of the EG-CFG project:
Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance for Code Generation.

Our changes extend the internal decoding loop in
`transformers/generation/utils.py` to support execution-aware generation.
Specifically, the modifications enable token-level integration of runtime
feedback during inference, allowing the model to dynamically condition on
execution traces.

All changes are clearly marked in the source code using the following comment block:
